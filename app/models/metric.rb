  # stime      This is the total amount of time spent executing in kernel mode, expressed
  #            in a timeval structure (seconds plus microseconds).
  # maxrss     This is the maximum resident set size used (in kilobytes). For RUSAGE_CHILDREN,
  #            this is the resident set size of the largest child, not the maximum resident
  #            set size of the process tree.
  # minflt     The number of page faults serviced without any I/O activity; here I/O activity
  #            is avoided by "reclaiming" a page frame from the list of pages awaiting reallocation.
  # majflt     The number of page faults serviced that required I/O activity.
  # inblock    The number of times the file system had to perform input.
  # oublock    The number of times the file system had to perform output.
  # nvcsw      The number of times a context switch resulted due to a process voluntarily giving
  #            up the processor before its time slice was completed (usually to await availability
  #            of a resource).
  # nivcsw     The number of times a context switch resulted due to a higher priority process
  #            becoming runnable or because the current process exceeded its time slice.
